= Usage

You just do
  require 'rflight'
Everything is under the RubyFlight module.
Note: I used 'rflight' so that the RubyFlight name of the C extension wouldn't
conflict with rubyflight.rb (on windows they're the same thing).

= Testing & Example

There's a test.rb file which is a tinty client application to FS using
RubyFlight. You can use this as an example. To run this, just do
  ruby test.rb
with FS open, and you'll get a periodical reading of various FS variables.
