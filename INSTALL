= Requirements
Since this is a Windows-only extension (it wouldn't make sense otherwise), you
need:
 * SWIG for windows (called swigwin on swig's site)
 * Ruby for Windows
 * VC6
 * FSUIPC SDK
I recommend the One-Click installer, as it will require less work.
If you download the binary version, you need the get-text package for windows
(only the iconv.dll is necessary). Copy this dll to you system32 dir (or put it in the
same dir as client.rb).

The bad thing is that you need VC6 (Visual C++ 6), as it
wont work with newer VC versions (this is sort of a Ruby issue, and a SWIG
problem with nmake). Tell me if you think it should be solved by now.

You'll need to get SWIG, nmake and ruby on your PATH variable. The nmake part
is done by running a file called vcvars32.bat or something like that. You
should configure VC6 to get the correct paths to the Include/Lib dirs and such.

= Source Installation

After installing/configuring the previous software, you need to put the IPCuser.c,
IPCuser.h and FSUIPC_User.h files on the ext/ directory. Then, just do:
  ruby setup.rb
Which will do config (create the C extension), setup and install.
