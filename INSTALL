= Compilation Requirements
Since this is a Windows-only extension (it wouldn't make sense otherwise), you
need:
 * Ruby One-Click Installer, MinGW32 version
 * Ruby Installer's DevKit (see rubyinstaller.org for that)
 * FSUIPC SDK
 
Place IPCuser.c, IPCuser.h and FSUIPC_User.h under the ext folder.

= Source Installation

Finally, you can bring up a console (Start->Execute-> "cmd"), change into your
rubyflight folder and run:
  ruby setup.rb
Which will configure (i.e.: create the ruby extension), setup and install.
