= Requirements
Since this is a Windows-only extension (it wouldn't make sense otherwise), you
need to get swig for windows first (called swigwin on swig's site). Then, get
Ruby for windows (either the "binary" version, or the one-click installer).
Finally, the ugliest part, you need to compile this with VC6 (Visual C++ 6),
it wont work with newer VC versions (this is sort of a Ruby issue, and a swig
problem with nmake).

You'll need to get swig, nmake and ruby on your PATH variable. The nmake part
is done by running a file called vcvars32.bat or something like that. You
should configure VC6 to get the correct paths to the Include/Lib dirs and such.

Also, you'll need the get-text package for windows (only the iconv.dll is
necessary). Copy the dll to you system32 dir (or put it in the same dir as
client.rb).

= Installation
Open an MS-DOS console and go to src/. Then:
  swig -c++ -ruby -Wall RubyFlight.i
  ruby extconf.rb
  nmake install
  
Then, copy the 'rubyflight' directory and the 'rubyflight.rb' file into the
lib/site_ruby directory of Ruby.

= Usage

You just do
  require 'rubyflight'
Everything is under the RubyFlight module.

= Testing
You can run
  ruby test.rb
with FS open, to get a periodical reading of some variables.
